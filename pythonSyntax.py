"""
PYTHON INDENTATION
Indentation is the spaces at the beginning of a codeline.
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
It is used to define a block of code.

"""
#Example
if 5>2:
    print("5 is greater then 2")  #Indented line

#PYTHON VARIABLES
# - A variable is a container for storing data values that can change during the execution of a program.
# - In python variables are created when you assign a value to it.
# - Python has no command for declaring a variable.
# - A variable can hold different data types such as integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.
# - Variable names must start with a letter or the underscore character.
# - A variable name cannot start with a number.
# - Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables).
# - Variable names should not be a reserved word in Python (like keywords: if, else, while, for, etc.)
# - You can assign values to multiple variables in one line.
"""
#Example
x=5
z="Caroline"
print(x)
print(z)
"""
"""
PYTHON STATEMENTS
Statements are instructions that a Python interpreter can execute.
In python a statement ususally ends when the line ends. However, in some cases, a statement can span multiple lines.

"""
#Example
#print("Python is fun!")

"""
MANY STATEMENTS
In Python, you can write multiple statements in a single line by separating them with a semicolon (;).
"""
#Example
#print("Hello"); print("World");print("!");print("Welcome to Python")

#Best practice is to write one statement per line for better readability.

"""
PYTHON OUTPUT
In Python, the print() function is used to output data to the standard output device (screen).
Text in python must be inside quotes either single or double.
By default, the print() function ends with a newline character, which means that each print statement will be printed on a new line.
If you want to print multiple words on the same line, you can use the end parameter.

"""
#Example
#print("Hello World.", end=" ")  #This will print Hello World and stay on the same line
#print("Welcome to Python")      #This will print Welcome to Python on the same line
#print(2 + 3)  #This will print the result of 2 + 3 which is 5
"""
PYTHON OUTPUT NUMBERS
Examples
print(5)
print(3.14)
print(2 + 3) -will output 5
print(10 / 2) -will output 5.0

MIX TEXT AND NUMBERS
Example
print("I am", 20, "years old.")
"""
#Example
#print("I have", 3, "cats and", 2, "dogs.")
