PYTHON INDENTATION
Indentation is the spaces at the beginning of a codeline.
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
It is used to define a block of code.

"""
#Example
if 5>2:
    print("5 is greater then 2")  #Indented line

#PYTHON VARIABLES
# - A variable is a container for storing data values that can change during the execution of a program.
# - In python variables are created when you assign a value to it.
# - Python has no command for declaring a variable.
# - A variable can hold different data types such as integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.
# - Variable names must start with a letter or the underscore character.
# - A variable name cannot start with a number.
# - Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables).
# - Variable names should not be a reserved word in Python (like keywords: if, else, while, for, etc.)
# - You can assign values to multiple variables in one line.
"""
#Example
x=5
z="Caroline"
print(x)
print(z)

PYTHON STATEMENTS
Statements are instructions that a Python interpreter can execute.
In python a statement ususally ends when the line ends. However, in some cases, a statement can span multiple lines.

"""
#Example
#print("Python is fun!")

"""
MANY STATEMENTS
In Python, you can write multiple statements in a single line by separating them with a semicolon (;).
"""
#Example
#print("Hello"); print("World");print("!");print("Welcome to Python")

#Best practice is to write one statement per line for better readability.
