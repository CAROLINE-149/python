PYTHON VARIABLES
A variable is a container for storing data values that can change during the execution of a program.
In python variables are created when you assign a value to it.
Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable can hold different data types such as integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.
Variables do not need to be declared with any particuler type and can even change after they have been set.

Examples
x=5
y= "Sally"
"""
#Example
#x=4
#x="Sally"  # x is now a string
#print(x) #This will output Sally

"""
CASTING
Also called type casting/ type conversion, is the process of changing a value from one data type to another.
"""
"""
#Example
x= str(3)    # x will be '3'
y= int(3)    # y will be 3
z= float(3)  # z will be 3.
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
"""
#x=10
##y=float(x)  #y will be 10.0
#print(y)

"""
GET THE TYPE
You can get the data type of a variable using the type() function.
"""
#Examples
"""
x=5
y="Hello"
print(type(x)) #outputs: <class 'int'>
print(type(y)) #outputs: <class 'str'>
"""

#Python Multiple Varible Values
"""
x=y=z="Caroline"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
"""
"""
x,y,z="Red","Blue","Green"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
"""
"""
fruits=["apple","banana","cherry"]
x,y,z=fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
